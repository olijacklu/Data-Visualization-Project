## Analysis of global out-of-school rates over last 50 years

In my project, I analysed the global out-of-school rates over the last 50 years (1970-2020). The goal of my project was to get a better understanding of how these rates have evolved over time and how they differ between countries, as well as between genders. Furthermore, I attempted to draw some conclusions on the linear relationship between the out-of-school rate and other key factors, such as the GDP per capita and the unemployment rate. All in all, I wanted to find out whether or not we are heading in the right direction when it comes to ensuring that children/young adults are well-educated.

I was able to get my datasets "education_data" and "aggregated_education_data" from the *The World Bank* website, while it is originally provided to them by the *UNESCO*. I have added the link down below, which allows you to replicate the download of the datasets by selecting the same columns I did in the "Education Statistics" section.

The "country_continent" dataset was manually filled in by me, with the help of *Wikipedia*, since I was unable to find a suitable dataset that provides the country and its respective continent.

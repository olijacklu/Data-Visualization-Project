# Data-Visualization-Project

I will be analysing the out-of-school rate over time for every single country. I will try to find out whether or not we are heading in the right direction when it comes to ensuring that children/young adults are well-educated. Furthermore, I will attempt to understand the linear relationship between the out-of-school rate and other key factors.
